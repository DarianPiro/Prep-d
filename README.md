## Getting Started

Before moving ahead, you will need to create a [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) account to save your recordings and create an upload preset (a repository for saving your Cloudinary files). 
You will also need an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

In the `/client` folder, create a file called .env.local:

```bash
touch .env.local
```

Copy the contents of the .env.sample file into the .env.local file and add your data:


In the `/server` folder, create a file called .env:

```bash
touch .env
```

Copy the contents of the .env.sample file into the .env file and add your data:

## Running the app
In order to install all the required dependencies, open a terminal from the root folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```
Once the installation is completed, simply run:

```bash
npm run start:server-client
```

To obtain a comprehensive summary of the API endpoints, please refer to this [Postman collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/25563730/2s93RRvskj).


## Alternatively:

### Back End

From the root folder, `cd` into the `/server` folder and run `npm i` in order to install all dependencies.


Open 'node_modules/pdf-parse/index.js'

Change line 6 to:

let isDebugMode = false;

Once this is done, run `npm run server` to initiate the server on port 4000.

### Front End

Open another terminal and `cd` into the `/client` folder. If you are still in the server folder, `cd ..` into the root folder first, before moving into the client.

Once in the client folder, install all dependencies using `npm i`. Then, run `npm start` to run the scripts and connect the front end. Once all of the above steps are taken, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
